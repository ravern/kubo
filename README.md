# Kubo
Lightweight package to write command line apps in Go.

## Aims
To be (and remain) as **lightweight** as possible, while still providing
sufficient features to build rich command line applications. Also to
be easy to **understand** and **use**.

## Installation
For now, use `go get` (waiting for `vgo` to become official)
```bash
$ go get github.com/ravernkoh/kubo
```
